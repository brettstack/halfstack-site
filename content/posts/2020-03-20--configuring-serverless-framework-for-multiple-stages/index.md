One of my favorite features of <a href="https://serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless Framework</a> is its `custom` section that lets you specify variables. With vanilla <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation</a> you have <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html" target="_blank">Parameters</a> at your disposal, however, they're limited to static `Default` values; i.e. you can't provide dynamic values based on stage values or other inputs (you *can* <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/dynamic-references.html" target="_blank">use dynamic values stored in other AWS services within your CloudFormation template</a>, but that's a little different).

Serverless Framework lets us define variables based on inputs, compose variables, and even create maps so that we can have different values based on stage/environment. However, it's not perfect. In order to access a stage-specific value, I use `${self:custom.stages.${self:provider.stage}.domainName}` -- quite wordy. To make this more accessible, I often duplicate the value into a second variable to make it more accessible via `${self:custom.domainName}`. Annoying, but manageable.

Here's a simplified serverless.yaml showing how I configure and use environment-specific values:

```yaml
provider:
  profile: ${self:custom.stages.${self:provider.stage}.profile}

custom:
  stages:
    dev:
      profile: halfstack_software_dev
      domainEnabled: false
    staging:
      profile: halfstack_software_staging
      domainEnabled: true
      domain: staging.halfstack.software
    prod:
      profile: halfstack_software_prod
      domainEnabled: true
      domain: halfstack.software
  domainName: ${self:custom.stages.${self:provider.stage}.domain}
  domainEnabled: ${self:custom.stages.${self:provider.stage}.domainEnabled}

resources:
  Conditions:
    UseDomainName:
      !Equals
        - ${self:custom.domainEnabled}
        - true
```

One alternative for stage-specific values is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-dotenv-plugin" target="_blank">serverless-dotenv-plugin</a> package. This plugin even allows you to create files like `.env.development` and `.env.production` and it automatically uses the appropriate file when running `NODE_ENV=production sls deploy`. üëç

My personal preference is to store my non-secret values in serverless.yaml and resort to `.env` for secrets only (even better, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/" target="_blank">Use AWS Secrets Manager</a> üîí). This approach makes it easier for developers to set up the project on their machine (they don't need to create a `.env` file), and grants you version control over these values since they're checked into your source code repository.

You can see the example above also includes a `profile` config for each stage. These all have an accompanying profile entry in `~/.aws/credentials` that lets me easily <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-multi-account-billing-strategy/" target="_blank">deploy to different AWS accounts based on stage</a>. Keep in mind that for any production system that's receiving traffic, **it's dangerous to have production profiles on your local development machines** lest you accidentally deploy to production (plus, I hear it's a security risk? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

```txt
[halfstack_software_dev]

aws_secret_access_key = aB1Cd2aB1Cd2aB1Cd2aB1Cd2+73f8+nWFQ
