In November 2018 AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/" target="_blank">AWS Amplify Console</a>, a service that provides "Hosting for fullstack serverless web apps with continuous deployment". The naming is a little confusing because a) it's hard to distinguish from <a href="https://aws-amplify.github.io/" target="_blank">AWS Amplify Framework</a>, and b) it's not *just* a console.

Prior to Amplify Console, I'd write the 100+ lines of YAML needed to set up a static website with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">S3</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank">CloudFront</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route53</a>. Now I'm able to achieve that same setup on top of the other great features of Amplify Console in less than 40 LOC.

```yaml
service: my-website
provider:
  name: aws
  region: us-east-1
  variableSyntax: "\\${{([ ~:a-zA-Z0-9._@\\'\",\\-\\/\\(\\)]+?)}}"

plugins:
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin

      Properties:

        EnableAutoBuild: true
        Stage: ${{self:custom.amplifyStage}}

    AmplifyDomain:
      Type: AWS::Amplify::Domain
      Condition: UseDomainName
      Properties:
        DomainName: ${{self:custom.domainName}}
        AppId: !GetAtt AmplifyApp.AppId
        SubDomainSettings:
          - Prefix: ${{self:custom.branch}}
            BranchName: !GetAtt AmplifyBranch.BranchName

  Outputs:
    DefaultDomain:
      Value: !Sub ${{self:custom.branch}}.${AmplifyApp.DefaultDomain}

    BranchUrl:
      Condition: UseDomainName
      Value: !Sub ${AmplifyBranch.BranchName}.${AmplifyDomain.DomainName}
```

If you're using a custom domain, you may need to perform some additional DNS steps (based on your provider), and you'll need to approve the SSL Certificate.

I noticed Amplify doesn't kick off the first build for you automatically even though we specify `EnableAutoBuild: true`. Maybe there's some other parameter that can be set to do this, but I couldn't find it. Simply log into the AWS console, navigate to your app in AWS Amplify, and initiate a build.

While AWS Amplify does a great job of setting up basic Continuous Deployment for you, it leaves much to be desired for business-critical apps. No multi-stage pipeline, no alarm/time blockers, and no auto-rollbacks (or even manual rollback for that matter). Maybe in the future they'll have deep integration with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/" target="_blank">AWS CodePipeline</a>.

I haven't tried this yet, but you should be able to set that up yourself by disabling `EnableAutoBuild` on your production branch (leave it on for PR previews! Another awesome feature I hadn't mentioned), and configure your CD pipeline to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/amplify/start-job.html" target="_blank">start-job</a>. Rollbacks might be a challenge still, but maybe you can leverge the `commit-id` parameter. If you try this out (or any other method of advanced CD with Amplify Console) let me know how it goes!
