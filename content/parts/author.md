As a veteran of over 10 years in the software industry, I have experience across a wide range of areas in software development. Iâ€™m currently a Staff Software Engineer at Wizeline where I help improve the performance of software teams.

Prior to Wizeline, I helped shape the direction of Serverless at Amazon Web Services (AWS) by providing input across UI, API, Architecture, CI/CD, DevOps, Open Source Software, and Product. I led teams for API Gateway, Serverless Application Repository, and Serverless Open Source Software.
