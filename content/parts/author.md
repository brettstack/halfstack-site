I've covered a wide range of areas during my 10+ years of experience in the software industry. I helped teams within the Serverless organization at Amazon Web Services (AWS) by providing input on UI, API, Architecture, CI/CD, DevOps, Open Source Software, and Product. I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at Wizeline, where I help improve the performance of software teams.
