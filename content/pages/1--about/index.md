## Projects

### Lead engineer for AWS SAM (Serverless Application Modal)

![AWS SAM](./aws-sam.png)

[SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) is an open-source framework and AWS service for defining Cloud-Native Serverless applications as infrastructure as code (IAC). I led the engineering team responsible for designing and implementing new features, responding to customers’ GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, and deploying and operating the service. I designed and implemented the CD pipeline, metrics, and team processes to improve the operational excellency and performance of the team and product.

[aws-serverless-express](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express) is a library for running [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and other Node.js web frameworks on [Serverless AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) using [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/). The project is used by thousands of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) customers for running production applications of all scales, has over 3k stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express), and is downloaded over 800k times a month on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express).

I was responsible for the inception, implementation, maintenance, support, documentation, releases, and growth for this product. You can see [my blog post on the AWS Compute Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/going-serverless-migrating-an-express-application-to-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/) as well as [a blog post by Jeff Barr](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/running-express-applications-on-aws-lambda-and-amazon-api-gateway/).

### Founding member and senior engineer of Serverless Application Repository

The [​Serverless Application Repository​](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) is an AWS service enabling customers to publish serverless applications, tools, and plugins that can then be deployed into other AWS accounts. As a founding and senior member of the team, I had significant input on defining team processes and the design of the service.

As Scrum Master for this Agile team, I organized sprints, prioritized roadmaps/backlog, ran sprint planning and retrospective meetings, and was responsible for the overall success of each sprint. I worked with Product Managers to design new features for the service based on customer feedback and was the engineering lead for the UI.

### Launch member and lead UI engineer for Amazon API Gateway

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) allows customers to define HTTP/REST APIs to interface with various integrations (primarily, [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda)). I led the development of the UI for this service and helped modernize UI development within the organization by providing guidance on modern web development techniques (ECMAScript 6+, Webpack, automated testing, etc.) to teams such as Lambda and Cognito.
