I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Wizeline](https://www.wizeline.com/), where I help improve the performance of software teams. Prior to that, I helped teams within the Serverless organization at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in areas such as UI, API, Architecture, CI/CD, DevOps, Open Source Software, and Product.
