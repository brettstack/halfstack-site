As a founding and senior member of the team, I had significant input on defining team processes and the design of the service.

As Scrum Master for this Agile team, I organized sprints, prioritized roadmaps/backlog, ran sprint planning and retrospective meetings, and was responsible for the overall success of each sprint.
